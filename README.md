# Firstsource Hackathon

Welcome to the Hackathon, today, you will be creating a game of prediction based on the latest prices of BTC to USD. 



### Phase 1: 

Subscribe to [API]() and get the latest prices of BTC to USD. Then, create a webpage, or a CLI application to show live prices. From the current moment until user left the session.



### Phase 2:  

Let user select his/her predication for price in next 15 seconds. For the sake of simplicity, the user can only select if the rate goes up (from the current point) or lower. 

Store the values of userâ€™s prediction in a persistent data store.

Display win/lose status of the prediction at the end of the prediction. (again on GUI or API).



### Phase 3: 

Show the scoreboard of users based on how many time wins/loses.



### Bonus: 

Develop a websocket API server for your application's realtime communication. 

Display user's historical predictions. 



### Notes:

Please note that below items will have an impact on how our proctors will judge your work: 

1. Test coverage. 
2. Well written git commit messages
3. Error handling and exception handling
4. Data structures and code readability.

You can ask about the issues you may face during this hackathon. Our proctors are here to not only monitor the process, but to help you get the insights needed as well.
